smartfeed
=========

This plugin began as a POC of angular.js with elgg.

My goal is to create a good start to build real complex feed UI, including filtering, sorting and more.

It also can be used as a angular-elgg-seed.



Install:

1. Download and install this plugin at smartfeed directory in elgg/mod.

2. Implement the fetch_new_items & get_feed so they match the Mock structure.

3. Activate the plugin via plugin management panel.
